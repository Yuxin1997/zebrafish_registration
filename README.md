# zebrafish_registration

## General pipeline
Here is what we need to do in daily data analysis registration part. 

## Construct own template
For the fish line there are no standard atlas as reference, we need to build our own template. In daily data analysis, out own template could also taken as bridge between z stack and standard atlas. The accuracy will be improved a little bit by that. 


## To be done in next step:
- [ ] optimize the registration call for different fish line and quality control
  - [x] HSA line
  - [ ] HUC line
  - [ ] 119B line
  - [ ] 76A line
  - [ ] 116A line
  - [ ] Y333 line
  - [ ] ILHX9 line
  - [ ] Gab1B line

- [ ] Superimposed figure drawing
  - [ ] asking Baier lab for transparent template
  - [ ] Superimposing the registered neurons onto the transparent template
